# Model Adaptation Examples

This repository contains example code demonstrating various model adaptation techniques covered in the Model Adaptation lecture at Fontys University of Applied Sciences (FICT), minor [AI for Society](https://www.fontys.nl/en/Study-at-Fontys/Exchange-programmes/Artificial-Intelligence-For-Society.htm) by Leon van Bokhorst.

## Overview

The codebase explores three key areas of model adaptation:

1. **Prompting Techniques** (`01_prompting.py`)
   - Basic prompting
   - Structured prompts
   - Chain-of-thought
   - Few-shot learning
   - Role playing
   - Task decomposition
   - Zero-shot learning
   - Self-consistency
   - Constrained generation
   - Socratic method
   - Reflective prompting
   - Guided feedback
   - Persona-based prompting
   - Template-based prompting
   - Comparative analysis
   - Iterative refinement
   - Scenario-based prompting
   - Self-verification
   - Logical verification

2. **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** (`02_rag.py`)
   - Document storage and embedding generation
   - Semantic similarity search
   - Query routing based on intent classification
   - LLM-based response generation
   - Multiple specialized demo modes
   - Support for both Ollama and OpenAI backends

3. **Semantic Space Visualization** (`03_semantic_space.py`)
   - 2D and 3D visualization of semantic embeddings
   - Multiple dimensionality reduction techniques (t-SNE, PCA, UMAP, MDS)
   - Semantic similarity heatmaps
   - Hierarchical clustering dendrograms
   - Word analogy visualization
