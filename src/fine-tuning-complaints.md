# Overview of fine-tuning complaints

This code is fine-tuning a smaller version of Llama (1B parameters) to generate complaints about various topics. Think of it like teaching an AI to be professionally grumpy! ðŸ˜„

## Key Components

1. **Data Preparation**
   - We use a dataset of synthetic complaints
   - We filter for high-quality complaints that are:
     - Negative in tone
     - Subjective (opinion-based)
     - Complex enough to be interesting
     - Long enough to be meaningful (>20 words)

2. **Training Approach**
   - We use a technique called Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) which is like teaching new skills to the AI while keeping most of its original knowledge intact
   - The training is optimized for Apple Silicon (M-series chips)
   - We use small batch sizes (2 examples at a time) to prevent memory issues
   - Training runs for 3 epochs (3 complete passes through the dataset)

3. **Quality Control**
   - We regularly test the model during training (every 200 steps)
   - We measure:
     - How negative the generated complaints are
     - The model's learning progress
   - We use Weights & Biases (wandb) to track all these metrics

4. **Safety Features**
   - Gradient checkpointing to manage memory usage
   - Error handling throughout the process
   - Automatic device selection (CPU/GPU)
   - Memory-efficient text processing

## Real-world Analogy

Think of it like teaching someone to write restaurant reviews, but specifically focusing on complaints. We:

1. Show them lots of example complaints
2. Have them practice writing their own
3. Check their work regularly
4. Keep track of their improvement
5. Make sure they maintain a consistent style

The end result is an AI that can generate context-appropriate complaints about almost any topic!
